Recipe Robot is the easiest way to create new [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg) recipes for simple Mac apps. It consists of two components:

- A __[Python script](#python-script-usage)__ that takes various types of input and automatically outputs AutoPkg recipes.

- A __[native Mac app](#mac-app-usage)__ that puts a friendly face on the Python script and makes it as simple as dragging and dropping. (Requires macOS 11 or higher.)

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot/releases/latest), or see detailed [requirements and installation steps](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot/wiki/Installation-and-Requirements) on the wiki.

> [!TIP]
> As of 2025, over 20% of the publicly available recipes in the [AutoPkg organization](https://github.com/autopkg) were created with the help of Recipe Robot!
