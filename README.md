[![Recipe Robot](images/header.png)](#)

Recipe Robot is the easiest way to create new [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg) recipes for simple Mac apps. It consists of two components:

- A __[Python script](#python-script-usage)__ that takes various types of input and automatically outputs AutoPkg recipes.

- A __[native Mac app](#mac-app-usage)__ that puts a friendly face on the Python script and makes it as simple as dragging and dropping.

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot/releases/latest), or see detailed [requirements and installation steps](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot/wiki/Installation-and-Requirements) on the wiki.

For helpful information on using Recipe Robot, including tutorials and troubleshooting information, see the [wiki](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot/wiki).

If you encounter a reproductible problem with Recipe Robot, I encourage you to open an [issue](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot/issues) on GitHub.

Enjoy!
