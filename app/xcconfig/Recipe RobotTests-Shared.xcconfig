// Framework Search Paths
//
// This is a list of paths to folders containing frameworks to be searched by the
// compiler for both included or imported header files when compiling C, Objective-C,
// C++, or Objective-C++, and by the linker for frameworks used by the product. Paths are
// delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them must be properly quoted.

// This is a list of paths to be added to the `runpath` search path list for the image

//
