Jotting these down in the hopes of keeping track of which ones I've started using.

%PROD% - The name of the app.
%AUTHOR_IDENTIFIER% - The preferred identifier prefix of the recipe author.
%PKG_IDENTIFIER% - The bundle identifier of the app.
%DESCRIPTION% - The description that will appear in Managed Software Center or in Casper Self Service.
%PARENT_RECIPE% - The parent recipe of the recipe being generated.

%SPARKLE_URL% - The Sparkle feed URL (NSFeedURL in Info.plist).

For .download recipes that use GitHub as the source:
%GH_OWNER% - The owner's username on GitHub (e.g. sheagcraig).
%GH_REPO% - The repo name on GitHub (e.g. jssimporter).

We'll need a bunch more for JSS recipes, including:
%CATEGORY% - JSS category.
(Can use existing JSSRecipeCreator for this.)

Probably some for SCCM, Absolute, and DS too.
